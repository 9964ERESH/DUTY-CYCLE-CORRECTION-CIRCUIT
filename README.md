# DUTY-CYCLE-CORRECTION-CIRCUIT
In the realm of modern digital circuit design, achieving precise timing requirements is a fundamental challenge 
that directly influences the integrity and functionality of electronic systems. One critical aspect of achieving 
such precision lies in the management of duty cycles within digital signals. The duty cycle, defined as the ratio 
of a signal's active time to its total period, plays a pivotal role in ensuring optimal signal propagation, 
synchronization, and data transmission. To address this crucial requirement, the duty cycle correction circuit 
serves as an indispensable tool.
